For me personally, he speaks to the working class and young Americans, and he has correctly noted that the current economic and political system in the US just isn't working. As someone who attends Johns Hopkins, I am acutely aware that I am one of the more priveledged individuals in America, yet I still am able to see that the American system is unsustainable in it's current form. I believe Senator Sanders is the only one who is able to bring real structural change to the American system, and he has proven this by building a mass movement without the support of any corporate interests backing his campaign.","","Bernie Sanders","4"

"2020/02/17 4:23:30 PM EST","International Political Economy","MA","2020","Pete Buttigieg","Gabbard is more interested in stirring the pot than running the country.

Billionaires using their personal wealth to finance their campaign is undemocratic and should be limited along with citizens united. Personal spending on a campaign should have a cap just like donations have a $2,800 limit, perhaps raised to $10,000-$100,000 to allow lesser-known candidates to use their savings to start their campaign. This eliminates Steyer and Bloomberg.

Klobuchar would be a great vice president and implementing the president's agenda, but her skills are more important in management than leadership. She will be an important asset in wrangling Congress, but the presidency is about more than spending all day getting republicans and democrats to work together on a bill. She doesn't have the vision or forward-looking nature I am looking for.

I see similar qualities in Biden. Above all I am turned off by entitlement and Joe Biden is the definition of the candidate who thinks its ""his time"" just like Hillary Clinton thought it was her turn to be president. While he would surely undo as much damage as he can through the executive branch, all of the candidates will do that. Supporting a candidate requires more than that and unfortunately he's happy to to put the country in neutral for 4 years when we don't have 4 years to waste. 

Sanders is completely uninterested in debate, considering others' ideas, or working together whatsoever. I think the lack of representation of his form of politics in the House and Senate shows a lack of support at the state level in any form of a socialist revolution. 

That leaves Warren and Buttigieg. I think both do well in presenting their idea, though different, of a next generation of American politics. Both are well-versed in policy and could return civility to politics. Warren, brings more experience, but Buttigieg's moderation may be more palatable to a larger number of supporters. However, Buttigieg's lack of support (and frankly disappointing record on race) is troublesome in terms of election and policy. That being said, choosing a vice president of color would help both of these areas, particularly if this vice president is given significant responsibility in tackling issues of race. 

Overall, I have to choose the candidate whose vision for a country I believe in most and that is Buttigieg. While there are areas I would like too see him improve on, I have to trust in his ability to govern and that he will surround himself with the right people to tackle the areas in which he is weakest.
